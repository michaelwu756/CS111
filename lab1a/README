This submission includes:

lab1a.c - source file for the project that can be compiled into an executable
that echos out input. If run with the --shell option then the program creates a
child shell that it pipes the keyboard input to. Exiting is achieved by either
doing ^D or ^C.

Makefile - contains targets for make clean, dist, and all to compile the
program.
