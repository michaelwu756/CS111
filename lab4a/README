my_beaglebone.jpg: A picture of me holding my beaglebone.

connected.png: A screenshot of me running hostname to show that I changed the
hostname to 404751542.lasr.cs.ucla.edu and me running ifconfig to show that my
wlan0 has an IP address of 192.168.0.20 and a MAC address of 2c:f7:f1:06:55:60.

copy.png: A screenshot of git bash on windows, a bash emulator, running scp to
copy a hello world source file to the home directory of root on my beaglebone
over wifi.

build_run.png: A screenshot of me connecting to my beaglebone through wifi at
192.168.0.20, compiling the hello world source file, and executing it.

git.png: A screenshot of me connecting to my beaglebone through wifi at
192.168.0.20, adding my ssh-key to ssh-agent, running apt-get to install git,
and cloning my CS111 project repo. I had setup a login script to automatically
add an ssh-key I generated earlier to ssh-agent. I did this in order to be able
to authenticate myself when cloning my git repo. Git was already installed when
I ran apt-get.
