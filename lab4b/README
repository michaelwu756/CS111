This submission includes:

lab4b.c: Source code that runs on a beagleboard green wireless with a
base cape attached. It assumes a temperature sensor is attached to
AIN0 and a button is attached to GPIO_115. It uses a timer to output
the temperature at a regular period. Can specify period in seconds
with --period=N and the temperature scale in either Celsius or
Fahrenheit with --scale=C|F. Can log output to a file with
--log=FILE. Default parameters are period=1 and scale=F. Run as root
if the beagleboard cannot init AIN0 or GPIO_115. During execution it
takes the commands START, STOP, PERIOD=N, SCALE=C|F, and OFF.

Makefile: Builds the executable lab4b as a default target. Includes
standard targets make dist and make clean. Make check runs the lab4b
executable and tests the above features.
