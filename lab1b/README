This submission includes:

Makefile: builds the client and server applications.

lab1b-client.c: This compiles into a program that connects to the server on a
port given by the required --port option. It sends characters to the server so
that the server can execute the commands on a shell. The client echos the shells
output back. Can use the --log option to view all bytes sent through the
network. Can use the --encrypt option to specify a file to use as a key for
encryption.

lab1b-server.c: This compiles into a program that listens on a port given by the
required --port option for the associated client program, which sends characters
over the network to be forwarded by the server to a shell to execute. Can be
used with the --encrypt option to specify a file to use as a key for
encryption. The client must use the same key in order to facilitate proper
communication.

my.key: a file containing a string of random characters to use as a key for
encryption.
